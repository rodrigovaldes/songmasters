# Songmasters

Git Hub repository for the Big Data project Songmasters, which utilizes the OneMillionSongs database. Our main tool is Google Cloud using 21 nodes.

The primary objective is to compare each combination of songs. Then, according to their observable features, we can recognize the most eclectic songs, formulaic songs, similar and dissimilar songs, among others. The applications can be above this, but we needed to finish the analysis at some point.

Please see our presentation for more information.
